      <description>I previously worked on a website application using Bootstrap and jQuery. So naturally I gravitate towards these frameworks whenever I do web coding. But it turns out that I never considered Vue.js before, and I always thought of Vue.js as something like Bootstrap (I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, by the way). Vue.js is something more like jQuery in addition to other equally impressive frameworks like React and Angular. I actually wanted to learn React on my own, but since I have to use Vue this time around, I decided to learn it instead.</description>

      <description>Software engineering is a messy process, but so is every creative human activity. Sometimes, I do wonder whether it is true that software engineering can be said to be a branch of &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo;. I leave that debate to another day, but in no uncertain terms, creating software is messy and often requires a lot of commitment, collaboration, and compromise from all stakeholders. In all my software engineering projects, I have not encountered a project that is smooth sailing from the onset and ends on a smooth sailing note.</description>
