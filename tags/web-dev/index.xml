      <description>I previously worked on a website application using Bootstrap and jQuery. So naturally I gravitate towards these frameworks whenever I do web coding. But it turns out that I never considered Vue.js before, and I always thought of Vue.js as something like Bootstrap (I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, by the way). Vue.js is something more like jQuery in addition to other equally impressive frameworks like React and Angular. I actually wanted to learn React on my own, but since I have to use Vue this time around, I decided to learn it instead.</description>
